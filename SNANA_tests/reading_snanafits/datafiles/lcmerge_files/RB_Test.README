SNLS lightcurves compiled by G.Miknaitis.
From Astier 2005.

Jan 28, 2008 RK:
   Remove anomolous r-band flux at MJD=52873.4300 (SN 03D4at)
   Was contributing 30 units of chi2 at Trest ~ 35 days.

   Remove anamolous g-band flux at MJD = 53165.41 (SN 04D3df)
   Was contributing 10 units of chi2 at Trest = 31 days.

Apr 4, 2008, GM:
   Set redshift errors to 0.001, to represent measurement error only.
   Astier et al notes that these errors are actually 0.01 when z is
   measured from SN spectra.  Will update if we receive information about
   which SNLS SNe are affected.

   Copied from old version 'SNLS' using snana command: 
   'copy_SNDATA_version.cmd  SNLS  SNLS_Ast06'

Jul 16, 2008 RK:
   Add the following to IGNORE file:
   IGNORE:  04D3df  53182.360 z  (chi2=13 at Trest = 42 d)
   (causing fitted PEAKMJD to stray)
 

Jun 25, 2010:
  Replace old-style verbose format with TERSE format
  since there is no meta data (PSF,skynoise ...) to
  include for the verbose format. See scripts in
    /home/s1/rkessler/snana_debug/reformat/SNLS_Ast06-terse .
  
  Old-style format is archived here:
       archive/SNLS_Ast06_2009-03-16.tar

  Checked that new=old for SALT2 c,x0,x1,t0.
